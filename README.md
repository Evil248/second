## About
This project is developed as final project for Harvard University's CS50x Introduction to Python Course, in December 2023.

This is a simple trivia game based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. It allows you to test your knowledge in 10 different subjects:
1. history
2. geography
3. worldwide literature
4. math
5. english
6. space
7. psychology
8. biology
9. programming
10. chemistry

On November 6 OpenAI released lots of customized chatbots based on GPT-4. After watching several tutorials of people creating their chatbots, I got inspired to develop my own chatbot.

## Features & implementations
- You can test yourself on those 10 topics
- The game greets you by the name you input
- Using `random` module, it randomly chooses 3 topics
- You are able to choose the topic you prefer the most
- The game saves your overall best score and from each topic
- You can continue playing for however long you like
- Even if you are playing infinite number of times, questions will always be different .

## Instructions on Usage
- Make sure that all the files are in the same folder, e.g. `project`
- Change your directory to the folder you keep the files, e.g. `cd path\project`
- Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt` at your IDE's terminal (or command prompt). This will successfully install all necessary libraries.
- Start the program at your IDE's terminal (or command prompt) by executing `python main.py`
